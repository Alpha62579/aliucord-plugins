# `Aliucord Plugins`

Some Aliucord plugins that I wrote without learning Java in the first place.

## Install

1. Just download the damn zip from the builds branch and just shove them into your plugins directory.
2. Just do step 1.

## License

No you don't have any license to use this code because this is prolly bad code and you're better off learning from someone else. Seriously.
